This also applies to cases where IMPROD AB arranged/ordered delivery/collection. To the extent that IMPROD AB's own insurance, according to IMPROD AB's assessment, may apply, the lessee is liable for compensation for all costs incurred by IMPROD AB due to such damage, including deductibles agreed in IMPROD AB's insurance.",

If cancellation occurs later, 50% of the rental amount will be charged. If cancellation is made the day before or on the same day as the start of the rental period, 100% of the rental amount will be charged. For equipment booked but not collected, the agreed rental cost is charged unless otherwise agreed.",
        "point8": "If the lessee does not take into account the above rental conditions, delays the agreed payment, goes bankrupt, ends up insolvent, is declared incompetent, dies or in some other way breaks the rental agreement entered into, IMPROD AB has the right to immediately repossess the equipment and cancel the agreement. In that case, the lessee must pay the rental cost until the day IMPROD AB takes the equipment back.",
